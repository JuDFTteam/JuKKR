Interpolation of potential to new mesh and on-the-fly shape-function generation

Possible problems:

*) Small deviations observed when restarting a calculation (6. digit after .):
   Might be due to (non-optional) mesh interpolation
   
*) Number of mesh points depends on an algorithm using floating point numbers:
   However, processes working on the same atom must arrive at the same results.
   Otherwise there will be problems with spin/energy-parallelisation
