This is a tool to inflate (converged) input data to supercells
The following input files from the small cell need to be copied into this directory:
- rbasis.xyz
- potential
- shapefun
- (voro_weights)
- (nonco_angle_out.dat)

Then set up a text file named 'inputcard' which contains the word 'BRAVAIS' in the first line
and the Bravais vectors of your small unit cell underneath, e.g.

BRAVAIS
1.0 0.0 0.0
0.0 1.0 0.0
0.0 0.0 1.0

Open the script 'create_data.sh' and adjust
- num_atoms_in
- inflation_factor
- sf_header_lines 

Run 'create_data.sh'! Input data for the supercell can be found in directory 'newcell' afterwards.
