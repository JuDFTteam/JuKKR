The program xsf_maker generates an .xsf file using KKR structure info

Compilation: ifort xsf_maker.f90 -o xsf_maker

Usage: ./xsf_maker < xsf_input

Input: see xsf_input for an example

Output: filename.xsf

The .xsf can then be imported into Vesta, and the geometry easily analyzed

Useful options are: 
-> conversion from a.u. to Angstrom
-> shift of the basis vector (for nicer display in Vesta)
