This is a helper tool to find a block tridiagonal partitioning of a sparse matrix.
It reads in the file couplings.dat which is written in clsgen_tb.F90 and contains the couplings between the different sites in the unit cell according to the screening clusters.
The program tries to find block partitions up to a maximum number of blocks in a brute force way.
It's nice when it works.

Compilation: ifort block_partitioning.F90 -o block_partitioning
Input: couplings.dat
Execution: ./block_partitioning

An example couplings.dat is provided.
