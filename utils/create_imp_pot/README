This program is useful for IMPURITY programm. 

It reads impurity.coefs file created by tb-kkr and corresponding 
tb-kkr potential and creating Starting potential for impurity programm
(composed.potent).

New feature was added: Possibility to replace some atoms in your new 
composed.potent from arbitrary potential file. Command line looks like:
create_imp_pot ./HOST.POT -map ARBITRARY.POT 
Program will ask you then which potential from composed.potent should be replace by which potential from ARBITRARY.POT. 
! Important to note is, that host atoms from composed.potent are not numbered, so numbering is starting from 1 for first atom of your impurity cluster

! PLEASE BE ALSO CAREFULL THAT YOU TITLE LINE OF POTENTIAL
! INCLUDES string "exc:" on position "37 -- 40"
